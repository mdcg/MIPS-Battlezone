*Battlezone - Game developed using MIPS Assembly Language Programming*

First of all, this is not really the source code for the famous Atari game released in the 1980s. This project was developed during my graduation in one of my favorite subjects called "Computer Architecture".

To run the code, I suggest you use MARS. MARS is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.

Feel free to use and modify the code. Share with me also suggestions and changes you made, if you want.

## MIPS

MIPS (an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer Systems). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; as well as five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and 64-bit implementations, respectively). As of April 2017, the current version is MIPS32/64 Release 6. MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS Iâ€“V by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the user mode architecture.


## Battlezone (1980)

Battlezone is a first-person shooter tank combat arcade game from Atari, Inc. released in November 1980. The player controls a tank which is attacked by other tanks and missiles. The game uses wireframe vector graphics on a black and white (with green and red sectioned color overlay) vector monitor. It was designed primarily by Ed Rotberg, who designed many games for Atari Inc., and later Atari Games, and Sente.
